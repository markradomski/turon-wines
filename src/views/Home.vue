  <h1 class="text-3xl mt-8 px-8">Our story</h1>
  <div class="mt-8 px-8">
    We aim to create elegant wines with intense flavour, wines that are
    approachable and yet intriguingly complex. With a love for the environment
    and sustainable practices at every step. We grow grapes and produce wines
    with minimal intervention. These are vegan-friendly and express the natural
    characters of our terroir and the grape variety. Our minimal intervention
    approach to winemaking means having the confidence to stand back and let the
    wine be itself, but the knowledge to step in and guide the wine in the right
    direction when necessary. Ultimately we endeavour to create wines that bring
    joy and will be here for future generations.
